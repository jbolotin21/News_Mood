Observations:

1. Fox and CBS seem to have the greatest polarity on when viewing the Sentiment Analysis of Media Tweets, which comes as a little bit of a surprise as I anticipated Fox, but not CBS.
2. As to the Overall Media Sentiment on twitter, the New York Times blew away the competition, which was very surprising. One would think there would be little difference between each outlet, but NYTimes has a very negative Tweet Polarity.
3. I am surprised on how neutral BBC News is. This makes me appreciate the work they do more because this would lead me to believe all they want to do is tell a neutral truth of the world today.
